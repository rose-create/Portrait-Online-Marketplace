# Portrait-Online-Marketplace

  ## What does your project do?

This is my submission for the final project for the Blockchain Developer Online Bootcamp 2020 course.
I decided to create an online portrait market system where buyers can buy goods displayed by portrait artists.
there will be a list of portrait artists on the platform.
The platform is managed by a group of administrators, the group of administrators will allow portrait artists to add portraits to the market.
Portrait artists can manage their store's inventory and funds. Buyers can visit stores and buy goods that are in stock using crypto currency.
The value I have added is the visibility of the works of artists in my country.
And the interest I will have in return, on each painting sold I will have a percentage.

## User stories
Any individual is able to interact with the dapp, however, you need to download a portrait from your computer to an external device. So you can add portraits to the market. Once a portrait has been added, you can also update it if it is incorrect. To view the portrait we go to a file called upload.php in our project
 you will first have to apply for approval. This application for approval may be approved or rejected by the applicant. Once approved, you can enter the applicant's address to display their contact information. I've also built an extra feature on the dapp where if you exchange metamask accounts, the dapp will be reflected on the fly to show you your last active account. This ensures that the address registered on web3 is the right one and that you are not signing the wrong transaction. Without further ado, let's proceed with the implementation!
